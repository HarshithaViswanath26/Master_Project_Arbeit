# Integration of Hybrid System Identification using Symbolic Regression into a Framework for Cyber-Physical System Modeling

## 📘 Overview  
This repository contains the work completed as part of the **Master’s Project Arbeit** titled:  
**“Integration of Hybrid System Identification using Symbolic Regression into a Framework for Cyber-Physical System Modeling.”**

The project focuses on integrating **hybrid system identification** techniques, specifically **symbolic regression**, into an existing modeling framework for **cyber-physical systems (CPS)**.  
The objective is to enhance the framework’s capability to model complex, nonlinear, and hybrid dynamics found in CPS by leveraging data-driven symbolic representations.
